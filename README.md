# 🐜 Ant-Sandwich Study: Statistical Analysis of Ingredient Influence on Ant Attraction

This repository contains the full analysis, visualizations, and code used in the report:  
**"Do Ants Have a Favorite Sandwich? A Statistical Analysis of Ingredient Influence on Ant Attraction"**, submitted as part of the MSc Data Science application at TU Dortmund University.

## 📊 Overview

This project explores whether specific sandwich ingredients—**bread type**, **topping**, and **butter presence**—significantly affect the number of ants attracted. Using a controlled dataset with 48 observations, a combination of **descriptive statistics**, **three-way ANOVA**, **assumption checks**, and **Tukey’s HSD post-hoc tests** was applied to identify the most influential factors.
